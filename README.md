# Summary
The project of development of solar eruption activities prediction models aiming to develop a series of codes that predict the arrival time of CME propagation to the Earth and whether a flare will erupt. Mainly including some mainstream machine learning methods such as SVM, RF, Adaboost, XGBoost ,CNN, PINN, Resnet and so on. We create this GitHub account with the intention of sharing our recent work on utilizing machine learning methods for CME and flare prediction as a series of programs, openly available for researchers in this field, facilitating the sharing and collaboration of scientific research to promote the advancement of the field. We intend to provide more detailed explanations regarding the codes and their usage in the future, enabling other researchers to correctly use and reference our work after a few more papers have been published.
